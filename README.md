# Topsify
A  group project for Purple Beard

Topsify allows users to search for their favorite bands and artists, making it effortless to explore the discography of various musicians.
With Spotify's API through the RapidAPI service. Including search-, album-, and artist endpoints.
The code fetches data from the Spotify-related API and dynamically generates HTML elements to display album covers, titles, and artist details.
Whether you're looking for a specific album or want to dive into the work of a particular artist, Topsify has got you covered.

Furthermore, Topsify incorporates an accordion functionality. Each accordion header is equipped with a click event listener, allowing users to easily expand or collapse content sections. This enables users to access information in a structured and organized manner.

For the design, we had the inspiration from music and motion, so then we choose a video background and we wrapped around all the other colors based on that. We tried to focus on 60-30-10 rule while making the website and also focused on not flashbang our future users. The layout really helps both mobile and desktop users to go over our content more easily.

In summary, Topsify is the ultimate music discovery tool. It combines a user-friendly interface, curated selection of albums and artists, convenient scroll and accordion functionalities, and seamless integration with Spotify's API. Give Topsify a try today and start exploring the world of music like never before!
